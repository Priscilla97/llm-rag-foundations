## 1. Presentation

“I have a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from Politecnico di Milano.
During my studies I focused on machine learning, deep learning and neural networks, working on both academic and practical projects.

Alongside my studies, I also worked as a robotics instructor, which helped me develop strong communication and teamwork skills.

## 2. Projects

### 2.1. Thesis

For my thesis, I developed and analyzed CNN and ResNet models for the classification of 2D maps in robotic exploration, working on data preprocessing, model tuning and evaluation.

**How the thesis help me with LLM?**
“Even though my thesis focused on CNNs and ResNet, it gave me a strong understanding of how large models are trained, fine-tuned and evaluated.
This helps me approach LLMs with a solid foundation, especially in terms of architecture, overfitting, and model analysis.”

**“Che esperienza hai con gli LLM?”**
“I don’t have extensive production experience with LLMs yet, but I have a strong background in neural networks and I’m actively studying how LLMs work, including fine-tuning and prompt design.
I’m very motivated to grow in this area and apply my skills in a real environment.”

### 2.2. Machine Learning

“During my studies I worked on several machine learning problems through practical assignments and projects.
I applied supervised learning techniques such as classification and regression, where I analyzed datasets, handled data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning and evaluation.”

**Che cosa ho imparato?**
This helped me understand how to approach a machine learning problem end-to-end.”

**Che modelli?**
“I worked with models such as logistic regression, decision trees and neural networks, depending on the problem.”
“For more complex tasks, I also worked with deep learning models.”

**In che modo mi aiutano con gli LLM?**
“When I approach a new model, I start by understanding the architecture, the data and the evaluation strategy.
This is the same approach I used for the thesis and i would use with LLMs.”
“LLMs are more complex, but the underlying principles are similar: data quality, training strategy, fine-tuning, evaluation and limitations.”

### 2.3. Adrenalina

**Come mi aiuta il progetto di Adrenalina?**
“Adrenaline was very important for me because it taught me how to work on a complex software system in a team, beyond academic exercises.”

## 3. Cosa voglio fare

ITA:
“Mi piacerebbe iniziare in un ruolo junior in ambito AI o Machine Learning, con particolare interesse per i modelli di linguaggio.
Vorrei lavorare su progetti concreti, capire bene come funzionano questi modelli e crescere tecnicamente nel tempo.”

ENG:
“I’m looking for a junior role in AI or Machine Learning where I can work on advanced models, including large language models.
I’m interested in both experimentation and practical applications, and I’m looking for an environment where I can learn and grow technically.”

## 4. In che modo i progetti mi aiutano con LLM? (general)

“That’s true, I haven’t worked on a full LLM project yet.
However, I have a solid background in machine learning and deep learning, and I’m actively studying LLM architectures and fine-tuning techniques.
I’m confident that with my foundations and learning approach, I can quickly become productive in this area.”

## 5. Cosa serve per fare un agente?

“At a high level, to build an agent for a specific task you need

- a clear definition of the task and its objective (goal)
- a model that can reason about the problem (LLM with prompt design)
- a way for the agent to interact with its environment (tool calling -> API, database)
- memory or context to keep track of previous steps,
- and a mechanism to evaluate and improve its behavior. (feedback loop -> meccanismo che misura se l’agente sta raggiungendo l’obiettivo)”

## 6. Conclusione

Right now, I’m very interested in roles where I can work with large language models, because I enjoy understanding how complex models work and applying them to real-world problems. I’m looking for a junior position where I can grow and deepen my skills in this area.”
